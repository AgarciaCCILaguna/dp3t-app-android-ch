<ol><li><strong>Scope and purpose</strong><ol><li>These Terms and Conditions of Use govern the acquisition and use of the application “SwissCovid app” (hereafter app) by users and form an integral part thereof.</li><li>The Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) app is based on the Epidemics Act of 28 September 2012 (EpG; SR 818.101) and the Ordinance of 24 June 2020 on the Proximity Tracing System for the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (VPTS; SR 818.101....).</li><li>The purpose of the app is to notify users who have potentially been exposed to the coronavirus and to produce coronavirus-related statistics.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Conditions of access and use</strong><ol><li>The installation of the app on a mobile phone and the employment thereof is voluntary for users.</li><li>The use of the app and its functions described in Section 3 is restricted to the territory of Switzerland.</li><li>By accessing the app, the user declares that he or she has understood and accepted the following conditions and legal information relating to the app (and the elements contained therein). If the user does not agree to these conditions, then the app is not to be used.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Functions of the app</strong><ol><li>Via the app, users are informed if they have been in relevant contact with at least one user confirmed to have been infected.</li><li>The activation of Bluetooth is required for the operation of the app.</li><li>Using an interface to the operating system of the user’s mobile phone, the app fulfils the following functions:</li></ol></li></ol><p>Each day, the operating system generates a new private key, which cannot be connected to the app, the mobile phone or users. Within the range of Bluetooth, the operating system exchanges with all compatible, running apps an identification code (random ID), changing at least every 30 minutes, which is derived from a current private key but cannot be traced back to this key and likewise cannot be connected to the app, the mobile phone or users.</p><p>On the mobile phone, the operating system stores the identification codes (random ID) received, the signal strength, the date and the estimated duration of proximity.</p><p>The app periodically retrieves a list of the private keys of users known to be infected and allows the operating system to check whether at least one locally stored </p><p>identification code (random ID) was generated by a private key included in the list. If this is the case, and if proximity of 1.5 metres or less to at least one infected user’s mobile phone was registered, and if the duration of all such proximity events within one day amounts to at least 15 minutes, then the app issues a notification. Proximity is estimated on the basis of the strength of the signals received.</p><ul><li><ol><li>If an infection is confirmed in a user, experts with access rights  (e.g. attending physicians) generate a unique activation code (Covid code), valid for a limited period, which they disclose to the infected user. This user can voluntarily enter the activation code in the app. Notification, or entry of the activation code, occurs only with the explicit consent of the infected user.</li></ol></li></ul><p>Other app users who came into proximity, as defined in Section 3.3, with the infected user during the infectious period are notified by their own apps.</p><p>The users thus notified learn that a proximity event has occurred, i.e. that they have potentially been exposed to the coronavirus, and on what date this was last the case. They are not told which user has been infected and has triggered the notification. The notification also informs the user about the Infoline offering free advice operated by the FOPH and the behavioural recommendations of the FOPH.</p><ul><li><ol><li>Users who are notified by their app that they have potentially been exposed to the coronavirus may, if they provide evidence of the notification, undergo, free of charge, a test for infection with, or for antibodies to, the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.</li><li>The app also communicates the behavioural recommendations of the FOPH.</li><li>The app does not track the user’s location or use geolocation services.</li><li>The app cannot perform a medical assessment, order any measures (e.g. quarantine), or issue any instructions.</li></ol></li></ul><ol><li><strong>Users’ duties of care</strong><ol><li>Users are responsible for technical access to the app.</li><li>Users are required to take the necessary security measures to protect their own devices against unauthorised access by third parties and against malware.</li></ol></li></ol><p>Users’ attention is hereby drawn to the security risks associated with use of the internet and of internet technologies.</p><ul><li><ol><li>Users are required to keep the app updated.
